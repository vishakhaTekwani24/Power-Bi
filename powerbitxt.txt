Question:2)
Explain the concept of data modeling in Power BI ?
Ans: Data modeling in Power BI is the process of structuring and organizing data from different sources to create meaningful relationships, improve performance, and enable better analysis. It involves defining tables, relationships, and calculations to build a logical data model that supports reporting and visualization.
-> Key Components of Data Modeling in Power BI
1. Tables & Relationships
In Power BI, data is stored in tables (similar to databases).
Relationships are created between these tables using primary keys and foreign keys.
Power BI supports three types of relationships:
One-to-One (1:1) – Each row in Table A matches exactly one row in Table B.
One-to-Many (1:M) – One row in Table A can relate to multiple rows in Table B.
Many-to-Many (M:M) – Multiple rows in Table A can relate to multiple rows in Table B.
2. Star Schema vs. Snowflake Schema
Star Schema: A central fact table (e.g., Sales) is connected to dimension tables (e.g., Products, Customers, Dates). It is simple and optimized for performance.
Snowflake Schema: Similar to a Star Schema, but dimension tables are further normalized (broken into smaller tables), reducing redundancy but adding complexity.
3. Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used to create calculated columns, measures, and tables.
Example:
DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Revenue])
DAX helps in performing aggregations, filtering, and complex business logic calculations.
4. Role-Based Security
Power BI allows defining row-level security (RLS) to restrict data access based on user roles.
Example: A sales manager may see only their region’s data.
5. Performance Optimization
Reduce dataset size using aggregations.
Use proper indexing and relationships to speed up queries.
Avoid complex DAX calculations that may slow down reports.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question: 3)
What are the different types of connections available in Power BI?
Ans: Types of Connections in Power BI
-> Import Mode:
.Data is imported and stored in Power BI.
.Fast performance but requires scheduled refresh.
.Suitable for small to medium datasets.
-> Direct Query Mode:
.Queries data live from the source.
.Ensures real-time data updates but may impact performance.
.Ideal for large datasets needing frequent updates.
-> Composite Mode (Hybrid Mode):
.Combination of Import Mode and Direct Query.
.Balances performance and real-time updates.
.Useful for scenarios needing both historical and live data.
-> Live Connection:
.Connects to Power BI datasets, Azure Analysis Services, or SSAS.
.No data is stored in Power BI; all queries run live.
.Best for enterprise-level centralized data models.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:4)
How do you handle data transformation in Power BI?
Ans: Data transformation in Power BI is done using Power Query Editor, which allows you to clean, shape, and modify data before loading it into the data model. Here’s how you can handle data transformation:

1. Importing Data
Connect to different data sources (Excel, SQL, APIs, etc.).
Load data into Power Query Editor for transformation.
2. Cleaning Data
Remove duplicates – Eliminate duplicate rows to ensure data consistency.
Handle missing values – Replace null values with default values or remove them.
Change data types – Convert columns to appropriate types (text, numbers, dates, etc.).
Trim and clean text – Remove unnecessary spaces and special characters.
3. Shaping Data
Rename columns – Make column names more meaningful.
Remove unnecessary columns – Keep only relevant data to optimize performance.
Split columns – Divide text data into multiple columns (e.g., splitting "Full Name" into "First Name" and "Last Name").
Merge columns – Combine multiple columns into one.
4. Creating New Columns
Custom Columns – Use formulas to create new columns based on existing data.
Conditional Columns – Apply IF-THEN logic to derive new values.
5. Aggregating & Summarizing Data
Grouping data – Summarize data based on categories.
Pivoting and unpivoting data – Reshape data for better analysis.
6. Merging & Appending Queries
Merge Queries – Combine data from multiple tables based on a common key (JOIN operation).
Append Queries – Stack datasets with the same structure (similar to UNION in SQL).
7. Using M Language
Power Query transformations are performed using M Language, which allows advanced scripting for data manipulation.
8. Loading Transformed Data
Load the cleaned and structured data into Power BI’s data model for analysis and visualization.
.Conclusion
Power Query Editor in Power BI provides powerful ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) capabilities to clean, shape, and optimize data for reporting and analytics.

Question: 5)
What is DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) and why is it important in
Power BI? 
Ans: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) is a formula language used in Power BI, Power Pivot, and SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services) to create custom calculations, aggregations, and business logic for data analysis. It is similar to Excel formulas but is more powerful and optimized for working with relational data and large datasets.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:6)
Can you explain the difference between calculated columns and
measures in Power BI? 
Ans: Definition:
Calculated Columns: Create a new column in a table, calculated for each row.
Measures: Perform dynamic calculations based on user interactions in reports.
Storage:
Calculated Columns: Stored in the data model, increasing file size.
Measures: Not stored; calculated on the fly, improving performance.
Context:
Calculated Columns: Works at the row level (row context).
Measures: Works at the aggregation level (filter/context-based).
Evaluation:
Calculated Columns: Computed during data refresh and stored permanently.
Measures: Evaluated dynamically based on report filters.
Performance:
Calculated Columns: Can slow down performance if overused due to storage impact.
Measures: More optimized, as calculations happen only when needed.
Use Cases:
Calculated Columns: Used for sorting, relationships, and predefined calculations.
Measures: Used for aggregations, KPIs, and real-time calculations.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question:7)
How do you handle relationships between tables in Power BI? 
Ans: In Power BI, relationships define how tables connect and interact with each other in the data model. Proper relationships ensure accurate data analysis and reporting.
1. Creating Relationships
Go to Model View in Power BI.
Drag and drop columns to establish a relationship between tables.
Use Manage Relationships to create or edit relationships manually.
2. Types of Relationships
One-to-Many (1:M) [Most Common]
One record in Table A relates to multiple records in Table B.
Example: One Customer → Multiple Sales Orders.
Many-to-Many (M:M)
Multiple records in Table A relate to multiple records in Table B.
Requires a bridge table for better performance.
Example: Products sold in multiple stores.
One-to-One (1:1)
Each record in Table A has exactly one matching record in Table B.
Example: Employee ID in Employee Details and Salary Table.
3. Relationship Cardinality & Properties
Single or Both Directions:
Single-direction (default) → Data filters from one table to another.
Both-direction (bi-directional) → Allows filtering in both directions (use cautiously).
Active vs. Inactive Relationships:
Active relationships are used by default in calculations.
Inactive relationships can be activated using USERELATIONSHIP() in DAX.
4. Handling Relationship Issues
Avoid circular relationships (Power BI does not support them).
Use surrogate keys if primary keys are missing.
Create a Star Schema instead of a Snowflake Schema for better performance.
